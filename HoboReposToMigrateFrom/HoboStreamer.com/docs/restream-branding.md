## 1. Profile Avatar / Profile Picture (All Platforms)

Used as: Twitch profile picture, Kick avatar, YouTube channel icon. Should be recognizable at small sizes (110×110 on Twitch, even smaller in chat).

### Image Generation Prompt

> **Prompt:** A minimalist logo icon on a pure black background. A stylized camping tent in dark charcoal gray with gold-amber (#c0965c) outline strokes. A small campfire with warm amber-gold flames sits in front of the tent. Two curved broadcast/WiFi signal arcs emanate from the top-right of the tent in gold, with a tiny red (#e74c3c) dot at the signal origin. Clean vector style, no text, no gradients, flat design with subtle depth. Square format, centered composition. High contrast against black for readability at small sizes.

### Notes
- Keep it simple — this is viewed at 28–110px. No fine details.
- The existing SVG logo at `public/assets/logo.svg` is the reference design.
- Generate at **512×512** minimum, export as PNG with transparent or black background.
- Use the same avatar across all three platforms for brand consistency.

---

## 2. Profile Banner / Channel Banner

Used as: Twitch profile banner (1200×480), Kick banner (1920×480), YouTube banner (2560×1440 safe area 1546×423).

### Image Generation Prompt

> **Prompt:** A wide cinematic banner for a streaming channel. The scene is a nighttime outdoor camp — a small tent glowing warmly from inside, a crackling campfire in the foreground casting amber-gold light, and a dark starry sky above. The mood is cozy, adventurous, off-grid. Overlaid on the right side in clean modern sans-serif typography: "HoboStreamer" in large gold-amber (#c0965c) text with "Streamer" in bold, and below it in smaller white text: "hobostreamer.com". Subtle broadcast signal arcs near the text suggest live streaming. Dark cinematic color grading. Wide aspect ratio (21:9 or wider). No people, no faces.

### Notes
- Generate at **2560×1440** to cover YouTube's requirement, then crop to platform sizes.
- Keep key text/elements in the center safe zone (1546×423) so it's visible on all devices.
- Alternative: Generate without text and add "HoboStreamer" + "hobostreamer.com" yourself in an image editor for crisper typography.

## Tips

- **Consistency is key** — use the same avatar, same gold-on-dark palette, same "HoboStreamer" branding across all platforms so people recognize the brand.
- **The URL is the payload** — every single element should contain or point to `hobostreamer.com`. It's the whole reason these channels exist.
- **Keep it genuine** — don't try to compete with Twitch/Kick/YouTube. Frame it as "the real stream is over there, this is just a taste."
- **Pin a chat message** on Twitch/Kick with: `🏕️ Watch the full stream with interactive chat at https://hobostreamer.com`
